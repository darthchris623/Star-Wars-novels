                The dying Empire's most cunning and ruthless warlord - Grand Admiral Thrawn - has taken command of the
                remnants of the Imperial fleet and launched a massive campaign aimed at the New Republic's destruction.
                Meanwhile, Han and Lando Calrissian race against time to find proof of treason inside the highest Republic
                Council - only to discover instead a ghostly fleet of warships that could bring doom to their friends and
                victory to their enemies. Yet most dangerous of all is a new Dark Jedi, risen from the ashes of a shrouded
                past, consumed by bitterness...and scheming to corrupt Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side.
