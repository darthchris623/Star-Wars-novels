            <h1>Star Wars novels</h1>
            <h2>The movies</h2>
            <p>Star Wars first premiered on May 25, 1977. Since then, it has exploded into a worldwide phenomenon
                with a huge fan base. The original trilogy is considered to be the best among Star Wars fans. There 
                is a prequel trilogy and a sequel trilogy. They were made at different times and don't quite
                correspond with the cronology of events within the movies themselves.

            <p>This is a list of Star Wars novels from the Expanded Universe. Most of these novels were written in the
                1990s by independent authors who are not affiliated with George Lucas. Since George Lucas sold Star
                Wars to Disney, the expanded universe has been rebranded as &ldquo;Legends&rdquo; and are not
                considered to be cannon anymnore. The original trilogy and the prequel trilogy are considered cannon
                and the two TV series The Clone Wars and Rebels remain part of Star Wars cannon. Furthermore, any Star Wars
                works produced by Disney since it acquired Star Wars from George Lucas - be they movies, books, comics, or
                TV series - are considered to be part of Star Wars cannon. But if you're a Star Wars fan and particularly a
                fan of the Expanded Universe/Legends, here is a list of novels that expand on the mystique of the galaxy
                far far away that we have come to love since the first movie premiered in 1977.</p>

            <h2>X-Wing series</h2>
            <p>This saga focuses on Wedge Antilles, a character breifly seen in the original Star Wars trilogy. He is leading an elite squadron of fighter pilots called Rogue Squadron in its struggle against the Empire several years after the events in Return Of The Jedi. The saga is about the Rebel Alliance trying to take back worlds from the Empire in an attempt to establish the New Republic - a nod to the Old Republic that was alluded to in Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope.</p>
            <blockquote>
                &ldquo;For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in <b>the Old Republic</b>, before the dark times, before the Empire.&rdquo;
                <br>
                - Obi-Wan Kenobi, Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                &ldquo;The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permananently. The last remnants of the <b>Old Republic</b> have been swept away.&rdquo;
                <br>
                - Grand Moff Tarkin, Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope
