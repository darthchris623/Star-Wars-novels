            <p>
                The embattled Republic reels from the attacks of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who has marshaled the Rebels back
                with an abbominable technology recovered from the Emperor's secret fortress: clone soldiers. As Thrawn
                mounts his final siege, Han and Chewbacca struggle to form a coalition of smugglers for a last-ditch attack
                against the Empire, while Leia holds the Alliance together and prepares for the birth of her Jedi twins.
                Overwhelmed by the ships and clones at Thrawn's command, the Republic has one last hope - sending a small
                force, led by Luke Skywalker, into the very stronghold that houses Thrawn's terrible cloning machines.

                There a final danger awaits, as the Dark Jedi C'boath directs the battle against the Rebels and builds
                his strength to finish what he had already started: the destruction of Luke Skywalker.
