            <img src="https://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/700jpg/9780553754865" />
            <p>The first book of the Thrawn Trilogy. Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa are married and are expecting
                twins. A mysterious new villain is leading the Empire and has plans for these unborn babies.

                It's five years after <i>Return Of The Jedi</i>: The Rebel Alliance has destroyed the Death Star, defeated
                Darth Vader and the Emperor, and driven the remnantsof the old Imperial Starfleet to a distant corner of
                galaxy. Princess Leia and Han Solo are married and expecting Jedi twins. And Luke Skywalker has become the
                first in a long-awaited line of Jedi Knights.

                But thousands of light-years away, the last of the Emperor's warlords has taken command of the shattered
                Imperial fleet, readdied it for war, and pointed it at the fragile heart of the new Republic. For this
                dark warrior has made two vital discoveries that could destroy everything the courageous men and women
                of the Rebel Alliance fought so hard to build. The explosive confrontation that results is a towering
                epic of action, invention, mystery, and spectacle on a galactic scale - in short, a story worthy of the
                name <i>Star Wars</i>.
